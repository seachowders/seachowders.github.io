=====================
I used bootstrap3 to help style my website.  I used the readmore plugin (available at : https://github.com/jedfoster/Readmore.js ) to add some interactivity to my projects and resume pages.  I also used the magnific popup ( available at : https://github.com/dimsemenov/Magnific-Popup ) to display some of my design projects in my projects section.
